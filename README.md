So guys, I'm not a programmer and I made this theme because I really wanted to have wiimenu as a frontend and I couldn't find it anywhere.

That said, feel free to modify the code and help me or even fork. 

What I'm bringing here is everything I know how to do so far, I'll keep studying and we'll see how far it goes!
